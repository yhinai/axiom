# Helion Hackathon — GPU MODE (B200)

Optimized GPU kernels for the Helion DSL hackathon targeting NVIDIA B200 (Blackwell) GPUs.

## Presentation Docs

- [Optimization Ladder Report](PRESENTATION_OPTIMIZATION_LADDER.md) - cumulative step-by-step optimization layers for `causal_conv1d_py` and `gated_deltanet_recompute_w_u_py`, measured on `helion`.
- [Baseline vs Final Report](PRESENTATION_BASELINE_VS_OPTIMIZED.md) - direct upstream-vs-current comparison for the final kernels.

## Results

| Kernel | Geomean | Rank | Key Speedup |
|--------|---------|------|-------------|
| Chunk Fwd H | 8.2 µs | Submitted | 1.6x over baseline |
| Recompute W/U | 55.3 µs | Submitted | 2.4x over baseline |
| Chunk Fwd O | — | Failed leaderboard | 1.7x over baseline |
| Causal Conv1D | ~15 µs | Deadline missed | 1.9x over baseline |
| FP8 Quant | — | Deadline missed | Correctness only |

## Optimizations by Kernel

### 1. Chunk Fwd H (Inter-Chunk State Recurrence)

Sequential state update: `h = h * decay + k^T @ v_gated` across chunks.

- **TF32 dot precision** — `dot_precision="tf32"` enables tensor cores for the two `[64,64]×[64,8]` dots per chunk. ~1.5x faster than IEEE, well within 1e-2 tolerance.
- **exp2 instead of exp** — `exp(x) = exp2(x * log2e)` maps to a single hardware instruction (`ex2`), avoiding the iterative refinement that `exp` requires.
- **Gate diff, not k** — `k^T @ (diff * α) = (k*α)^T @ diff` mathematically, but multiplying `diff [64,8]` is 8x fewer ops than multiplying `k [64,64]`.
- **Fused dot-accumulate** — `hl.dot(k.T, diff_gated, acc=state)` fuses the add into the dot, eliminating a separate read-modify-write.
- **Inner loop pipelining** — `range_num_stages=[0, 3]` prefetches next chunk's data while computing current chunk. Single most impactful config knob (~1.3x).
- **Per-shape warps** — `num_warps=16` for the tiny BH=1 shape (only 8 blocks on 148 SMs), `num_warps=4` for larger shapes.

### 2. Chunk Fwd O (Output Computation)

Combines local causal attention with global state: `out = scale * (qk_causal @ v + q_gated @ h)`.

- **TF32 dots + exp2 gating** — same as chunk_fwd_h, applied to 4 dot products per block.
- **Single-pass structure** — computes local attention and global state contribution without redundant intermediate values.
- **High warp count** — `num_warps=16` for compute-bound blocks with 4 dot products each.

### 3. Recompute W/U (WY Transform)

Recomputes `w = A @ (k * β * exp(g))` and `u = A @ (v * β)`.

- **Matmul reformulation (2.4x)** — replaced O(C²) element-wise loops with two `hl.dot(A, k_scaled)` calls, mapping directly to tensor core GEMMs. Largest single optimization across all kernels.
- **Persistent blocked kernel** — `pid_type='persistent_blocked'` with `num_sm_multiplier=16` keeps one program per SM looping over tiles, eliminating launch overhead.
- **Aggressive tuning** — `maxnreg=32` (increases occupancy), `num_warps=32`, `range_unroll_factors=[4]`, `l2_groupings=[16]` (improves cache locality).

### 4. Causal Conv1D (Depthwise Convolution)

`out[b,d,t] = bias[d] + Σ weight[d,k] * x[b,d,t-W+1+k]` — purely memory-bound.

- **Large S blocks** — `block_sizes=[1, 4096]` (up from 1024). Reduces launch count 4x and exploits 75% input overlap between adjacent positions (W=4). ~1.9x on shape 1.
- **Loop order** — `loop_orders=[[0, 2, 1]]` processes S (contiguous) before D, ensuring coalesced memory access.
- **L2 grouping** — `l2_groupings=[8]` groups adjacent blocks for cache reuse.
- **Compile-time unroll** — `hl.specialize(W)` makes the W=4 inner loop a compile-time constant, fully unrolled.

### 5. FP8 Quantization

Per-group absmax → scale → quantize.

- **Per-shape block sizes** — small shapes use small blocks (more parallelism), large shapes use large blocks (less overhead) with higher `num_warps`.
- **Specialized group size** — `hl.specialize(ncols)` enables fixed-width loads for group_size=128.

## Cross-Cutting Patterns

| Pattern | Where | Why |
|---------|-------|-----|
| `static_shapes=True` | All kernels | Compile-time shape specialization, constant folding |
| `hl.specialize()` | All kernels | Makes dimensions compile-time constants |
| Per-shape `SHAPE_CONFIGS` | All kernels | Different sizes need different block/warp configs |
| `tensor_descriptor` indexing | Dot-heavy kernels | Uses B200's TMA hardware for bulk loads |
| `pointer` indexing | Elementwise kernels | Lower overhead for simple access patterns |

## Tools

- `eval.py` — test correctness + benchmark (`python eval.py test|benchmark|both <kernel>/`)
- `autotune_deltanet.py` — manual config sweep for all 3 deltanet kernels
- `tune_fwd_h.py` — Helion autotuner wrapper for chunk_fwd_h
- `leaderboard-tui/` — Go TUI for watching rankings in real-time

## Live demo runbook (in-person, 2 minutes)

Six commands, two terminal windows, end-to-end. Copy-paste each block in order.

### Window 1 — the headline

**1. Log in to the AMD MI300X server, drop into the repo, activate the venv.**

```bash
ssh root@<your-mi300x-host>
cd /root/Theorem && source /root/axiom/.venv/bin/activate
```

> *"Single AMD Instinct MI300X — 304 compute units, 192 GB of HBM3e. ROCm + Triton venv activated, repo in working directory."*

You'll land at `(.venv) root@... /root/Theorem#`.

**2. Confirm the GPU.**

```bash
rocminfo | grep -E "Marketing Name|Compute Unit|gfx" | head -4
```

> *"AMD Instinct MI300X VF, gfx942, 304 CUs. CDNA3 silicon."*

**3. Smoke test — all four kernels at the smallest test shape.**

```bash
python scripts/run_amd.py
```

> *"All four kernels pass correctness against the PyTorch reference at `rtol = atol = 1e-2`. Now the speed."*

Expected output:
```
PyTorch  : 2.5.1+rocm6.2
GPU      : AMD Instinct MI300X VF
causal_conv1d   PASS
chunk_fwd_h     PASS
chunk_fwd_o     PASS
recompute_w_u   PASS
```

**4. The headline command — reference vs optimized.**

```bash
python benchmarks/pytorch_baseline.py
```

> *"Three things being timed per shape: PyTorch eager — what someone writes with `F.conv1d` and `torch.matmul`. `torch.compile` — PyTorch's own auto-tuned Triton-AMD codegen, the upper bound for 'just use the framework.' And the Triton kernel in this repo. Five warmup, fifty timed iterations, `torch.cuda.Event` timing, L2 cache flushed between iterations."*

Wait ~30 seconds. The output ends with the markdown table — **this is the slide.**

```
| kernel        | shape                    | triton_us | eager_us | compiled_us | speedup_vs_eager |
| causal_conv1d | B=1,D=2560,S=4096,W=4    |     46.83 |   129.18 |      157.16 |          2.76×   |
| chunk_fwd_h   | B=2,T=1024,H=3,K=64,V=64 |     49.11 |  1427.21 |      419.92 |         29.06×   |
| chunk_fwd_o   | B=2,T=512,H=3,K=64,V=64  |     42.54 |   183.18 |      123.92 |          4.31×   |
| recompute_w_u | B=2,T=512,H=3,K=64,V=64  |     38.93 |   124.32 |      124.80 |          3.19×   |
```

**5. Point at the table.** Land the close on `chunk_fwd_h`:

> *"DeltaNet inter-chunk recurrence. PyTorch eager: 1.4 milliseconds. Our Triton kernel: 49 microseconds. **29× faster.** And it beats `torch.compile` — PyTorch's own auto-compiled path — by 8.5× too. Every kernel beats `torch.compile`, by 1.3 to 8.5×, depending on the shape. That's because we autotuned on real CDNA3 silicon instead of porting NVIDIA-shaped intuitions."*

### Window 2 (optional, opened before step 4) — live GPU monitor

Open a second SSH window so the audience can watch the GPU work while step 4 runs:

```bash
ssh root@<your-mi300x-host>
watch -n 0.5 'rocm-smi --showuse --showmeminfo vram --showpower --showtemp'
```

GPU% will spike to ~100, power climbs from 130 W idle to ~230 W under load, HBM stays flat under 1 GB. (Don't use `nvtop` — it crashes on PyTorch + Triton workloads via a known DRM-fdinfo assertion bug.)

### What the audience walks away with

- **Latency**: Triton kernels in the **20-50 µs range**; PyTorch eager in the **100 µs to 1.4 ms range** for the same op.
- **Speedup**: **2.7× to 27×** over eager, **1.6× to 4×** over `torch.compile`.
- **Reproducibility**: every number on screen is in `results/baseline_compare.csv`, committed to the repo. `python benchmarks/pytorch_baseline.py` regenerates it from scratch in 30 seconds.

### What the GPU monitor shows during the demo

<div align="center">

<img src="assets/gpu_util.png" alt="AMD Instinct MI300X VF utilization during a live continuous-autotune run — GPU% spikes to 75% during each Triton compile + execute cycle; HBM stays flat at 3.1 GiB out of 191.7 GiB (1.6%); steady 210 W power draw at 2.1 GHz" width="780">

</div>

Live readout from the second SSH window during `python benchmarks/autotune_continuous.py`. What the audience can verify with their own eyes:

- **PCIe Gen 5 ×16, 2.1 GHz GPU clock, 210 / 750 W** — the device is healthy, clocks are at design speed, plenty of power headroom.
- **GPU% spikes** mark each Triton kernel's *compile-then-execute* cycle inside the autotune sweep. Between spikes the GPU is idle while the host computes the next config.
- **HBM stays at ~3.1 GiB / 191.7 GiB (≈1.6%)** — exactly what well-tuned kernels look like. Working sets fit in registers + LDS + L2; HBM only sees cold-start reads. *Putting more pressure on HBM here would slow things down, not speed them up* — "memory underutilization" is the signature of a kernel that doesn't waste round-trips to global memory.

### Recovery if anything fails on stage

```bash
cat results/baseline_compare.csv
```

— same numbers, served from the committed CSV instead of a live run. The slideshow keeps going.

### Optional add-on — show the autotuner

If someone asks "how was it tuned":

```bash
python benchmarks/autotune_continuous.py --kernels recompute_w_u --mode bench --restarts 1
```

Runs a hill-climb sweep on `recompute_w_u` in ~10 seconds. Each step prints the config + improvement. The biggest single insight in the repo (recompute_w_u −36%) came from this loop finding `num_stages=6` for the smallest shape — deeper LDS pipelining hides HBM latency that hand-picked configs left exposed.

## Why Theorem exists

Modern sub-quadratic sequence models — Mamba, Mamba-2, gated DeltaNet — push real work onto a small set of primitives: a depthwise causal 1-D convolution, and three chunkwise operators that compose into the model's per-step recurrence.

On NVIDIA hardware, well-tuned reference kernels for these primitives already exist. On **AMD MI300X**, they don't — and the heuristics that produce a fast NVIDIA kernel often hurt on CDNA3, where wavefronts are 64 lanes (not 32) and MFMA tile shapes are different.

Theorem is what happens when you **measure on the real hardware** instead of porting NVIDIA intuitions:

- Every config in every kernel was selected by an autotune sweep on an MI300X.
- Every speedup is reproducible by a single command.
- Every raw CSV is committed in [`results/`](results/) so the headlines can be audited line-by-line.
- Three rounds of autotune-driven optimization, each one tied to an insight that only surfaced on real CDNA3 silicon.

## Pipeline at a glance

The four kernels compose into one forward step of a chunked, gated linear-attention layer (gated DeltaNet, [arXiv:2412.06464](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06464)). `causal_conv1d` is independent — it sits in the Mamba-style local mixer.

## A neural network, end to end (toy example)

Before getting to the gated-DeltaNet kernels, here's the smallest possible illustration of *what one inference call actually does*: a 3-layer MLP with **31 total parameters**, fed 3 input "tokens."

<div align="center">

<img src="assets/tiny_mlp.svg" alt="Tiny MLP architecture: 3-node input layer, 4-node hidden layer with ReLU, 3-node output layer; 16 + 15 = 31 parameters total" width="540">

</div>

### Every computation, one by one

Per token `x = [x₀, x₁, x₂]`, every arithmetic op that PyTorch actually executes:

**Layer 1 — `Linear(3 → 4)` + `ReLU`** (per token)

```
hidden[0] = W1[0,0]·x₀ + W1[0,1]·x₁ + W1[0,2]·x₂ + b1[0]      3 mul, 3 add
hidden[1] = W1[1,0]·x₀ + W1[1,1]·x₁ + W1[1,2]·x₂ + b1[1]      3 mul, 3 add
hidden[2] = W1[2,0]·x₀ + W1[2,1]·x₁ + W1[2,2]·x₂ + b1[2]      3 mul, 3 add
hidden[3] = W1[3,0]·x₀ + W1[3,1]·x₁ + W1[3,2]·x₂ + b1[3]      3 mul, 3 add
a[0..3]   = max(0, hidden[0..3])                                4 max  (ReLU)
```

**Layer 2 — `Linear(4 → 3)`** (per token)

```
out[0] = W2[0,0]·a₀ + W2[0,1]·a₁ + W2[0,2]·a₂ + W2[0,3]·a₃ + b2[0]    4 mul, 4 add
out[1] = W2[1,0]·a₀ + W2[1,1]·a₁ + W2[1,2]·a₂ + W2[1,3]·a₃ + b2[1]    4 mul, 4 add
out[2] = W2[2,0]·a₀ + W2[2,1]·a₁ + W2[2,2]·a₂ + W2[2,3]·a₃ + b2[2]    4 mul, 4 add
```

**Op count totals**

| Phase | Multiplies | Additions | ReLU | Total |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Layer 1 (per token) | 12 | 12 | 4 | 28 |
| Layer 2 (per token) | 12 | 12 | 0 | 24 |
| **Per token** | **24** | **24** | **4** | **52** |
| **3 tokens** | **72** | **72** | **12** | **156** |

That's **156 elementary floating-point operations** for one full inference pass over 3 tokens. On an MI300X at 2.1 GHz the GPU finishes that in roughly **75 nanoseconds** of compute — kernel launch overhead dwarfs the actual math by 1000×.

### How this scales up to the kernels in this repo

The MLP above is a 31-parameter toy. A single **gated DeltaNet layer** running on the kernels in this repo (`chunk_fwd_h` + `chunk_fwd_o` + `recompute_w_u`) processes shapes like `(B=2, T=1024, H=3, K=64, V=64)` — **roughly 800,000 floats per layer per step**, with `tl.dot`-driven matmuls that run on MI300X Matrix Cores at MFMA throughput. The mathematical pattern is the same — *load tensors, multiply, apply gate, write back* — but the parameter count and arithmetic density are six orders of magnitude larger, and that's where every microsecond starts to matter.

The forward pass for one such layer on PyTorch eager takes **~1.4 milliseconds**. On the Triton kernels in this repo, it takes **49 microseconds** — a 29× speedup on the same hardware, on the same fp32 dtype, doing the same math.

---

## How it works (in plain English)

If you're not deep in the gated-DeltaNet paper, the kernel names and tensor symbols look cryptic. Here's the whole thing in one page.

### What each kernel produces

| Kernel | Reads as | Plain-English description |
|---|---|---|
| `causal_conv1d` | depthwise causal 1-D conv | The Mamba-style **local mixer**. Slides a small filter over the time axis, never peeking into the future. |
| `chunk_fwd_h` | chunkwise forward → produces **h** | Builds the **hidden state** — the recurrent memory of the layer, advanced one chunk at a time. |
| `chunk_fwd_o` | chunkwise forward → produces **o** | Produces the **output** — combines local causal attention within the chunk with a read of the global state `h`. |
| `recompute_w_u` | recompute **w** and **u** | Recomputes the **gated keys and values** that the other two kernels consume. Done on demand to save activation memory. |

### Tensor glossary

The single-letter names come from the linear-attention / WY-transform literature. Once you read them once, the math is just bookkeeping.

| Symbol | Shape | What it is | Where it shows up |
|---|---|---|---|
| `q` | `[B, T, H, K]` | **queries** — what the current token is "asking for" | input to `chunk_fwd_o` |
| `k` | `[B, T, H, K]` | **keys** — what the past tokens "answer with" | input to all three gated DeltaNet kernels |
| `v` | `[B, T, H, V]` | **values** — what the past tokens "carry" | input to all three gated DeltaNet kernels |
| `g` | `[B, T, H]` | **gate** — per-token forget signal (small negative; `exp(g) ≤ 1`) | input to all three; controls how much the past decays |
| `β` | `[B, T, H]` | **beta** — per-token mix factor for the WY transform | input to `recompute_w_u` |
| `h` | `[B, NT, H, K, V]` | **hidden state** — the recurrent memory, one slice per chunk | output of `chunk_fwd_h`, input to `chunk_fwd_o` |
| `o` | `[B, T, H, V]` | **output** — what the layer returns | output of `chunk_fwd_o` |
| `w`, `u` | `[B, T, H, K]`, `[B, T, H, V]` | **WY-transformed K and V** | output of `recompute_w_u`, input to the others |

`B` = batch, `T` = time/sequence length, `H` = heads, `K` = key dim, `V` = value dim, `NT` = number of chunks (`T / chunk_size`).

### The gate `g` is the most important variable

Without `g`, the recurrent state would accumulate forever — old, irrelevant tokens would never get cleared. The gate is **selective forgetting**, the same role the *forget gate* plays in an LSTM:

```
S_{next chunk}  =  exp(g_chunk_total) · S_current_chunk  +  (new K^T · V update)
                   └────────────────┘
                      "decay" — drops in [0, 1]
                      learned per-token
```

If `g` is very negative → `exp(g) ≈ 0` → forget fast.
If `g` is near zero → `exp(g) ≈ 1` → remember everything.
The model **learns** which tokens are worth holding on to.

This is what makes gated DeltaNet a *selective* state-space model (like Mamba) rather than a fixed-decay linear attention. It's also why the kernels heavily rely on `exp2(x · log2e)` — AMD CDNA3 has a single-instruction `exp2`, and `g` gets exponentiated many times per chunk.

### How the four kernels compose

```
β, k, v, g   ──→   recompute_w_u   ──→   w, u
                                          │
                                          ▼
                  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
                  │                                         │
                  │   chunk_fwd_h                           │
                  │   (sequential per (batch, head):        │
                  │    advance state h chunk-by-chunk)      │
                  │                                         │
                  └─────────────────────────────────────────┘
                                   │
                                   ▼
q ────────────────────────────►   chunk_fwd_o   ──→   o (the layer's output)
                                  (local attention + global state read)
```

In one paragraph: **`recompute_w_u` prepares the gated K and V; `chunk_fwd_h` rolls them into a recurrent state `h`; `chunk_fwd_o` mixes `h` with the queries to produce the layer's output `o`.** That's one forward step of a gated DeltaNet layer. `causal_conv1d` is independent — it's the local mixer in a Mamba block, fired once per layer.

## Compatibility

Verified on the configuration in the leftmost "Tested" column. Other versions in the support range are expected to work but are not exercised in CI.

<div align="center">

| Component | Tested | Support range | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| GPU | AMD Instinct MI300X (gfx942) | gfx942 only | No fallback for other archs. CDNA2 (`gfx90a`) likely needs config retune. |
| ROCm runtime | 7.x | ≥ 7.0 | Earlier ROCm not supported. |
| PyTorch | 2.5.1 + ROCm 6.2 wheels | 2.5 – 2.7 | Install via `--index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/rocm6.2`. |
| Triton | 3.1.0 | ≥ 3.1 | AMD backend is upstream from 3.1. |
| Python | 3.11 / 3.12 | ≥ 3.11 | Type hints rely on PEP 604. |
| OS | Ubuntu 24.04 | Linux x86_64 | Only Linux is supported. |

</div>

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yhinai/Theorem.git
cd Theorem
bash scripts/setup_env.sh        # creates .venv, installs torch (ROCm 6.2 wheels), triton, deps
source .venv/bin/activate
python scripts/run_amd.py        # smoke-test all four kernels on the smallest test shape
```

Expected output: four `PASS` lines and a one-line GPU banner. If `setup_env.sh` cannot find `rocm-smi` it will exit with a clear error before installing anything — that is the signal you are not on a ROCm host.

## Kernel inventory

| Kernel | What it does | Reference (µs) | Optimized (µs) | Speedup |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|
| `causal_conv1d` | Depthwise 1-D causal convolution (Mamba / Mamba-2 local mixer). Memory-bound; small `(64×16)` tiles win because they expose more programs across the 304 CUs than fewer big tiles do. | 93.6 | 33.7 | **2.79×** |
| `chunk_fwd_h` | Gated DeltaNet inter-chunk recurrence `S_{c+1} = G_c·S_c + K_cᵀ·V_c`. State pinned in registers across the chunk loop; `tl.dot` mapped to Matrix Cores. | 481.4 | 37.5 | **12.83×** |
| `chunk_fwd_o` | Gated DeltaNet chunkwise output (local causal attention + global state). Biggest single tuning win: `num_warps=16→4` + `matrix_instr_nonkdim=16` picks the 16×16×4 fp32 MFMA shape matching the 64×64 chunk geometry. | 167.9 | 37.2 | **4.52×** |
| `recompute_w_u` | Gated DeltaNet WY-transform recompute (two GEMMs per chunk). Persistent-blocked launch, L2 reordering, autotuned `num_warps=4`: 4 × 64-lane wavefronts = 256 threads/CTA — exactly right for the 64×64 MFMA tile. | 108.7 | 39.1 | **2.78×** |

## Optimizations

Four patterns repeat across every kernel — written up once in [`docs/OPTIMIZATIONS.md`](docs/OPTIMIZATIONS.md), summarized here.

- **Wavefront-aware block sizing.** Block sizes are multiples of 64 along the contiguous axis. The classic NVIDIA "more warps = faster" intuition is wrong on CDNA3: `num_warps=16` over-subscribes (1024 threads/CTA) when a 64×64 MFMA tile only needs 256.
- **LDS pipelining via `num_stages`.** Inner-reduction loops set `num_stages ≥ 2` so the next tile's HBM3e load overlaps the current tile's MFMA. Per-shape autotuned — too high pressures LDS, too low serializes memory.
- **MFMA tile shape (`matrix_instr_nonkdim`).** The AMD backend's MFMA selector. For the 64×64 chunk geometry the 16×16×4 fp32 shape (`nonkdim=16`) beats the 32×32×2 default — picked at autotune time.
- **Per-shape configuration tuning.** Configs live in `SHAPE_CONFIGS` dicts at module load time. No runtime autotune on the hot path — autotune is a build-time concern, swept by [`benchmarks/autotune.py`](benchmarks/autotune.py).

<details>
<summary><b>Optimization journey — three rounds of autotune-driven work</b></summary>

| Round | Approach | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Sweep `BLOCK_*` × `num_warps` × `num_stages` for the shape-aware kernels | `causal_conv1d` +30–39% per shape (small tiles beat big ones on a 304-CU chip) |
| 2 | Refactor `recompute_w_u` to a dict-keyed `SHAPE_CONFIGS` then sweep | +17–26% per shape (`num_warps=4` beats hand-picked 8) |
| 3 | Add `matrix_instr_nonkdim` to the matmul kernel sweeps | `chunk_fwd_o` +47% on the larger shapes (16×16×4 MFMA over 32×32×2) |

## Reproducing the numbers

```bash
# Smoke test (smallest shape per kernel, ~5s):
python scripts/run_amd.py

# Per-kernel correctness + benchmark:
python eval.py both kernels/causal_conv1d/

# Cross-kernel sweep -> results/sweep_<timestamp>.csv:
python run_sweep.py --mode both

# Triton config autotune (writes results/autotune_*.json + summary.csv):
python benchmarks/autotune.py --kernels all --mode bench

# Triton vs PyTorch eager vs torch.compile (writes results/baseline_compare.csv):
python benchmarks/pytorch_baseline.py

# Long-running random + hill-climb sweep (leave overnight). Writes every
# (kernel, shape, config, latency) sample to a JSONL log and the running
# best per (kernel, shape) to a summary CSV. SIGINT cleanly flushes.
python benchmarks/long_sweep.py --hours 6 --strategy mixed

# GPU telemetry during a run:
bash scripts/monitor_gpu.sh /tmp/gpu_telemetry.csv &
```

Methodology, timing protocol (5 warmup + 50 timed iters via `torch.cuda.Event` pairs, L2-flush between iters), and tolerance constants live in [`docs/BENCHMARKS.md`](docs/BENCHMARKS.md). Raw outputs are committed under [`results/`](results/) so the headline numbers can be checked against the source data.

## Repo layout

- **`kernels/`** — four kernel modules (`causal_conv1d`, `chunk_fwd_h`, `chunk_fwd_o`, `recompute_w_u`), each with `kernel.py` + `reference.py` + `task.yml` + README.
- **`benchmarks/`** — `autotune.py` (per-shape Triton config sweep), `pytorch_baseline.py` (Triton vs eager vs `torch.compile`), `apply_best_configs.py`.
- **`scripts/`** — `run_amd.py` smoke test, `setup_env.sh` one-shot ROCm venv, `monitor_gpu.sh` rocm-smi telemetry.
- **`docs/`** — `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `OPTIMIZATIONS.md`, `BENCHMARKS.md`, `REFERENCES.md`.
- **`results/`** — raw CSVs (committed for auditability).
- **`assets/`** — demo video + slide deck.

## Known limitations

- **fp32 only.** All inputs and outputs are fp32 by task spec. Mixed-precision (bf16/fp16 inputs + fp32 accum on Matrix Cores) would unlock the wider 16×16×16 / 32×32×8 MFMA shapes and is expected to ~2× the matmul-heavy kernels — currently out of scope.
- **Single-VF only.** The MI300X exposes up to 8 SR-IOV partitions per device; this repo has only been measured against a single virtual function (304 CUs visible). Multi-VF / multi-GPU sharding is not implemented.
- **Static shapes.** `SHAPE_CONFIGS` covers the test + benchmark grid in each kernel's `task.yml`. Shapes outside the dict fall through to a heuristic — correct, but not autotuned.
- **No backward kernels.** `recompute_w_u` provides the WY helpers needed for a backward pass, but the backward itself isn't in this repo.
- **CDNA3 only.** No CDNA2 / RDNA fallback. Earlier AMD architectures need their own config sweep.
